## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course _15.872 Introduction to System Dynamics_ as it was taught by John Sterman and Hazhir Rahmandad in Fall 2013.

_15.872_ _System Dynamics II_ is the second half-semester continuation of [_15.871 Introduction to System Dynamics_](/courses/15-871-introduction-to-system-dynamics-fall-2013). Students can take _15.871_ alone, or combine it with _15.872_. Taken in sequence the courses constitute the introductory sequence in system dynamics. Successful completion of both _15.871_ and _15.872_ is a prerequisite for advanced courses in system dynamics, work as a research or teaching assistant in the field, or careers using system dynamics.

During this second half of the semester, 2 class sections were taught by John Sterman and Hazhir Rahmandad. Sloan Fellows wishing to complete the course sequence were combined into these sections.

Professor Sterman gives [an introduction to system dynamics and an overview of the course sequence in this video](/courses/15-871-introduction-to-system-dynamics-fall-2013/pages/instructor-insights#insights).

## Course Outcomes

### Course Goals for Students

_15.871_ and _15.872_ introduce students to system dynamics modeling for the analysis of business policy and strategy. Students will learn to visualize a business organization in terms of the structures and policies that create dynamics and regulate performance. The class uses simulation models, case studies, and management flight simulators to develop principles of policy design for successful management of complex strategies, and to improve our understanding of the ways in which an organizationâ€™s performance is related to its internal structure and operating policies as well as those of customers, competitors, suppliers, and other stakeholders.

## How Student Time Was Spent

During an average week, students were expected to spend 7-10 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

### In Class

- Course met 2 times per week for 90 minutes per session; mandatory attendance.
- Recitation for review, where TAs fielded questions about the materials; optional attendance.

### Out of Class

- Weekly {{% resource_link de8f2acd-3b5a-c119-033e-6e6dcda1672c "readings" %}} in preparation for class
- Five {{% resource_link a612509c-75c6-f13a-1674-6950b7a59510 "assignments" %}} making use of modeling software
